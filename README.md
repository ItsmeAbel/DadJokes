# DadJokes
 
A webapp made using C# and the ASP.Net framework. I made the app to store my favourite dadjokes, hence the name of the app. It used a local mssql database for storing the jokes, and the users. There is a login and registering page where anyone can create an account so that they can store their jokes as well. The user can apply 2FA to their account if desired. Additionally the app follows the MVC model, where i have the option to easily switch the front end if i want to.
